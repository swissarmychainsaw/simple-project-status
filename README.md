## Status Report Generator - Usage Instructions

This application helps you create professional, executive-ready status reports with customizable design and multiple export options.

### Getting Started

1. **Program Title**: Enter your program or project name at the top of the form
2. **Report Date**: Select the date for your status report
3. **Fill in the required fields** in the left panel:
   - Program Summary (auto-expanding text area)
   - Status indicators (On Track, At Risk, Off Track)
   - Ownership fields (Program Manager, Tech Lead, etc.)
   - Executive Summary (auto-expanding with formatting toolbar)

### Using the Formatting Toolbar

The Executive Summary and Updates sections include formatting tools:
- **B** - Bold selected text
- **I** - Italicize selected text  
- **U** - Underline selected text
- Select text first, then click the formatting button

### Updates Section

The Updates section supports rich content including:
- **Tables**: Copy and paste tables from Confluence, Excel, or other sources
- **Formatted text**: Use the formatting toolbar for styling
- **Large content**: No character limits for complex status updates

### Design Customization

Use the Design panel to customize your report:
- **Font**: Choose from Inter, Arial, Segoe UI, Helvetica, or Georgia
- **Accent Color**: Pick a color that matches your brand
- **Density**: Choose Comfortable or Compact layout
- **Table Style**: Select Lines or Shaded borders
- **Custom CSS**: Add your own styling (advanced users)

### Export Options

Three ways to export your status report:

1. **Copy for Email** - Copies formatted content that preserves styling when pasted into email clients
2. **Copy HTML** - Copies the HTML source code for web use
3. **Download** - Downloads an HTML file you can save and share

### Tips for Best Results

- **Email Compatibility**: Always use "Copy for Email" when sending via email to preserve formatting
- **Large Tables**: The app handles complex tables from Confluence and other sources
- **Auto-Save**: Your work is automatically saved to your browser's local storage
- **Fixed Width**: Generated reports use a consistent 800px width for professional appearance

### Troubleshooting

- **Tables not showing**: Make sure you're using "Copy for Email" for email clients
- **Download not working**: The file may be saved to your default downloads folder
- **Formatting lost**: Use "Copy for Email" instead of "Copy HTML" for email clients
- **Content missing**: Check that all required fields are filled before generating

### Data Persistence

Your form data is automatically saved in your browser and will persist between sessions unless you clear your browser data or use the clear functionality.
